# Perplexity Sonar Reasoning Pro

Combines multi-step reasoning with web search for complex analytical queries.

## Specifications

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Model ID** | `perplexity/sonar-reasoning-pro` |
| **Context Window** | 127K tokens |
| **Input Price** | $0.002 / 1K tokens |
| **Output Price** | $0.008 / 1K tokens |
| **Capabilities** | web, thinking |

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { generateText, createGateway } from 'ai';

const gateway = createGateway({
  apiKey: process.env.AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY
});

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: gateway('perplexity/sonar-reasoning-pro'),
  prompt: 'Analyze the factors that led to the latest tech industry layoffs and predict future trends',
});

console.log(text);
// Returns step-by-step analysis with web-sourced evidence
```

## Features

### Multi-Step Reasoning

The model breaks down complex questions into steps, researching each part:

```typescript
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: gateway('perplexity/sonar-reasoning-pro'),
  prompt: 'Should I invest in renewable energy stocks? Consider current trends, government policies, and market forecasts.',
});
// Returns structured analysis with reasoning chain
```

### Research + Analysis

Combines web search with analytical thinking:

```typescript
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: gateway('perplexity/sonar-reasoning-pro'),
  prompt: 'Compare the economic impact of AI adoption across healthcare, finance, and manufacturing sectors',
});
```

### Complex Queries

Best for questions that require synthesis and judgment:

```typescript
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: gateway('perplexity/sonar-reasoning-pro'),
  prompt: 'What are the strongest arguments for and against remote work becoming permanent?',
});
```

## Best Use Cases

- Complex research requiring analysis
- Questions needing synthesis from multiple sources
- Comparative analysis (pros/cons, tradeoffs)
- Trend analysis and predictions
- Decision support with evidence

## Limitations

- **Reasoning only**: This is a reasoning-focused model
- **No streaming**: Responses are returned complete
- **No JSON output**: Cannot produce structured JSON
- **No tool calling**: Cannot execute custom functions
- **No vision**: Cannot process images

## Comparison

| Model | Reasoning | Streaming | JSON | Best For |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------|----------|
| Sonar | No | Yes | Yes | Quick lookups |
| Sonar Pro | No | Yes | Yes | Deep research |
| **Sonar Reasoning Pro** | Yes | No | No | Analysis & synthesis |

Choose Sonar Reasoning Pro when you need analytical thinking combined with current web data.

## Example: Investment Analysis

```typescript
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: gateway('perplexity/sonar-reasoning-pro'),
  prompt: `
    I'm considering investing in AI-focused ETFs.
    Please analyze:
    1. Current market trends for AI stocks
